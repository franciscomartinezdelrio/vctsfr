## Resubmission:

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Omitted the redundant *in R* from the title
* Changed the way the description field starts
* Removed the \donrunt{} in the examples of GUI_collection function

We have not included references in de description field because our package
is a tool not described anywhere.

## Test environments
* local Windows install, R 4.2.3
* Windows development version 
* Windows Server 2022, R-devel, 64 bit 
* MacOS

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release so 1 note is expected.
