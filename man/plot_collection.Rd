\title{Create the associated ggplot object of a time series belonging to a
collection}
\usage{
plot_collection(collection, number, methods = NULL, level = NULL, sdp = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{collection}{a list with the collection of time series. Each component
of the list must have been built with the \code{\link[=ts_info]{ts_info()}} function.}

\item{number}{an integer. The number of the time series. It should be a value
between 1 and \code{length(collection)}.}

\item{methods}{NULL (default) or a character vector indicating the names of
the forecasting methods to be plotted.}

\item{level}{NULL (default) or a number in the interval (0, 100) indicating
the level of the prediction interval to be shown. This parameter in
considered only when just one forecasting method is plotted and the
forecasting method has a prediction interval with the specified level.}

\item{sdp}{logical. Should data points be shown in the plot? (default value
\code{TRUE})}
}
\value{
The \code{ggplot} object representing the time series and its forecast.
}
\description{
Create a \code{ggplot} object associated with a time series belonging to a
collection. Apart from the time series, future values and forecasts for the
future values form part of the \code{ggplot} object.
}
\details{
The \code{collection} parameter must be a list. Each component of the list stores
a time series and, optionally, its future values, forecasts for the future
values and prediction intervals for the forecasts. Each component should have
been created using the \code{\link[=ts_info]{ts_info()}} function.

In the example section you can see an example of a collection of time series.
If the \code{collection} parameter is not specified correctly, a proper message is
shown.
